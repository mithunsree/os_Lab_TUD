Task 3.1	: Refer to program 3.1.c
Question 3.1	: The PID always changes and after re-initializing the global variable my_value to 18951 in child it retains its value 
		  throughout the execution.Since my_value is a global variable changes done to it in the child process will also be 
		  reflected in the parent process. 
Question 3.2	: Pipes perhaps not exactly the most efficient way to do so, though.Threads share all address space, so we can easily pass 
		  pointers around between threads, by stashing them in global variables or as an argument.
		  The overhead of creating and opening the file descriptors will be costly and also one way communication is not efficient.
		  The only advantage may be the syncronization between threads as one thread will only read and the other shall write.
